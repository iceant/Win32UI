Brahma
by Ralph Waldo Emerson

If the red slayer think he slays
  or if the slain think he is slain,
They know not well the subtle way
  I keep and pass and turn again.

Far or forget to me is near;
    Shadow and sunlight are the same;
The vanished gods to me appear;
    And one to me are shame and frame.

They reckon ill who leave me out
    When me they fly, I am the wings;
I am the doubter and the doubt,
    And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.

The strong gods pine for my abode,
    And pine in vain the sacred Seven;
But thou, meek lover of the good!
    Find me, and turn they back on heaven.
